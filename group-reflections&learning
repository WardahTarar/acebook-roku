## Day 1 - pairs to insert here please

Wardah & Bart:

* Learnt how to set up heroku app
* Learnt about automatic deployment and manual deployment
* The difference between CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment) is a lot clearer
* Got a better understanding on Travic CI, it checks if tests are passing and if there are any conflicts with master branch.

Greg & Sam 23/4/19

Today we have had initial group discussions in order to plan our team-working strategy from the very beginning 
of this project.  We have set daily start and finish times, as well as expectations regarding stand-ups and 
retrospectives.  We have also considered the best way to ensure that all team members are exposed to and work 
on all parts of the project.  We agreed to adopt an initial pair working protocol of changing partners between 
every morning and afternoon session.

Upon conclusion of this meeting, we broke into three pairs and worked on the self-allocated set-up tasks which 
were provided to us in the project specification.  Sam and I worked on adding Rubocop, SimpleCov and Flog, which 
are a linter, a test coverage checker and a complexity analyser respectively.  We have learnt that Flog provides 
us with a score and we have discovered that a score of 20 or under is optimal.  Scores of over 200 are possible, 
but highly inadvisable.  

Sam has shared the following resource (https://codeclimate.com/blog/deciphering-ruby-code-metrics/) which 
explains the rationale behind and usefulness of the various metrics we are utilising in this project.

## Day 2!

- Deployed Heroku from the command line.
- Set up the database using db:Migrate.
- Touched on ActiveRecord.
- Branching out for help when stuck on a problem caused it to move
along more swiftly. Also talking with our wonderful client (*wink wink Mike*)
caused us as a group to be assured that we were headed in the right direction.

Sam & Bart

### Retro after sprint 1
- Didn't skimp on the setup - took a long time but it was worth it
- Everyone knew what everyone else was doing
- Different pair taking on automated deployment when Sam/Bart were fried from looking at it
- Harry asking others for help with the deployment to Heroku
- Appreciated the explanation from Harry on the existing code so that we didn't duplicate effort

- We don't know enough about rails to be able to do this yet
- We didn't change pairs at lunch time - maybe try to stick to this?

## Day 3!

Wardah & Bart:

- Added a sign up form
- Made sure it was adding data into our database
- Added a log in form as well (created sessions controller for it and redirected it to posts page)
- Worked on the email authentication feature in backend (preventing incorrect email entry in DB)
- Added a regex code in the User model file as a security measure
- Tested it by manipulating the HTML in frontend and then checked DB, it wasn't added to the DB. Yay!

## Day 4!

Greg & Bart

- Manual email verification with a displayed message if user has erred
- Email verification blocks database insertion if invalid

Harry & Wardah

- Leanrt about how sessions work in Rails
- Learnt about destroying a session
