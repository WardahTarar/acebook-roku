## Day 1 - pairs to insert here please

Wardah & Bart:

* Learnt how to set up heroku app
* Learnt about automatic deployment and manual deployment
* The difference between CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment) is a lot clearer
* Got a better understanding on Travic CI, it checks if tests are passing and if there are any conflicts with master branch.

## Day 2!

- Deployed Heroku from the command line.
- Set up the database using db:Migrate.
- Touched on ActiveRecord.
- Branching out for help when stuck on a problem caused it to move
along more swiftly. Also talking with our wonderful client (*wink wink Mike*)
caused us as a group to be assured that we were headed in the right direction.

Sam & Bart

### Retro after sprint 1
- Didn't skimp on the setup - took a long time but it was worth it
- Everyone knew what everyone else was doing
- Different pair taking on automated deployment when Sam/Bart were fried from looking at it
- Harry asking others for help with the deployment to Heroku
- Appreciated the explanation from Harry on the existing code so that we didn't duplicate effort

- We don't know enough about rails to be able to do this yet
- We didn't change pairs at lunch time - maybe try to stick to this?
